      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p><strong>Name:</strong> Ratshili Masala Gift</p>
      <p><strong>Course:</strong> Final-year Computer Science student at Tshwane University of Technology (TUT)</p>

      <p>
        I am a tech enthusiast with a growing passion for cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and software development. 
        My journey into technology began with curiosity and was strengthened by academic exposure to Information Security, 
        where I discovered the fascinating world of protecting systems and data.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also participated in the <strong>Code Tribe online bootcamp</strong>, which enhanced my practical skills in software development and exposed me to real-world coding projects and teamwork.
      </p>

      <p>
        My mission is simple: to use my skills to build secure, impactful digital systems and to contribute to a safer cyberspace.
      </p>

      <p>
        I actively participate in platforms like <strong>TryHackMe</strong> and I am currently pursuing the <strong>Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)</strong> 
        course offered by ISC2. These hands-on experiences have deepened my understanding of vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Aside from cybersecurity, I privately tutor students in programming and web development — ranging from beginner to advanced levels. 
        I teach modules like Principles of Programming A & B, Object-Oriented Programming, and Advanced Java. This role has made me a better communicator, listener, and mentor.
      </p>
